Non code answers

A. The time complexity of magic number program is O(n) because it is a linear search.

B. The time complexity of reverse string program is O(n). n is the length of the string

D. remove method is faster in the linked list than array in an array because in the linked list 
    all we need to do is change the pointer to the next node, unlike linked list , in array
    we have to move all the elements after the removed element to the left by one position.

E. the main difference between them is camparing values of two objects and compare the references of two objects.
    equals() method is used to compare the values of two objects, 
    while the eqaulity operator (===) is used to compare the references of two objects.

F. method overloading is when we have two or more methods with the same name but different parameters, 
    while method overriding is when we have two methods with the same name and same parameters but different implementation.

G. Interface
        An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It defines a set of methods that a class must implement if it implements that interface. In other words, 
        an interface defines a contract that a class must adhere to. It specifies what a class can do (method signatures) without specifying how it does it (implementation details).

   Abstract
        Abstraction is a concept that allows you to represent the essential features of an object while hiding the implementation details. 
        It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and methods.
